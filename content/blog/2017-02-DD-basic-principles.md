What are the fundamental values that help you stay on track? What keeps you from changing your direction, from giving up, from accepting the _status quo_? Do you even know what it is?
 
I always wondered, what makes great people great? It is clear that there are personality traits that can help you achieve great things, but that can’t be  only it. Even if you were capable to get any skillset, wouldn't that be a tool? So, what is it that keeps you moving forward in situations of great turmoil?
 
Today, I'm lucky to know many amazing individuals who I also have pleasure of being friends with. It took me more than two decades and huge amounts of work towards a different direction than all the peers around me. It eventually paid out.
 
I did it all, from workshops, conferences, entrepreneurial programs, training, books, presentations and more. I chased the community that I wanted to be part of with fiery passion, ending up being one of the main forces for it to exist.
 
It wasn't easy and I was definitely not prepared for all the challenges I had to face and no one told me what those would be. Still this wasn't the hardest part. The hardest was dealing with all the naysayers. Keeping my spirit and motivations intact required me to design a whole system. From this system, I created a set of maxims, adages if you may, that continuously reminded and still remind me of what is important and of where I am headed.
 
Having a constant clear understanding of what I value has proven to be the best tool to defeat my fears. It is surprising that so few people are capable of telling what they care for, and how often that leads them off-track. I decided to write a post on some of these values as a reply to many friends that have asked me the what is my trick to continue working super hard.
 
Sharing these values, even if in a raw form, is a good exercise because it forces you to explain your ideas better.
 
## Two ears, one mouth
 
Nowadays, we are taught to listen to answer and not to interiorize. This behaviour leads to poor communication and often misunderstanding within teams.
 
If you are like me, your enthusiasm might try to drive entire conversations. This is often great as excitement is contagious, yet it comes with the risk of missing a contribution.
 
I need to revisit this one often, as I regularly fall into the trap of talking a lot.

We have a strategic plan, it’s called doing things

I stumbled upon this poster right at the end of my freshmen year in college. It became my laptop wallpaper for the rest of my degree.
 
I didn't know [Herb Kelleher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Kelleher) before, but the sentence resonated with me immediately.
 
It was very crucial to realise how even legends have walked through similar and humble paths. It taught me that I could do it too and, even if I didn't know how, I only had to keep trying.
 
Today, even when I'm not 100% confident of the right path, I know I need to keep doing things and that, eventually, I'll get there.
 
## You can be great, but you can’t do great work alone
 
Growing in a culture of elitism created a false perception that I wouldn’t ever be good enough, that I shouldn't bother. It took me a while to deconstruct that meme, but now it is quite simple.
 
In order to work in distributed teams of volunteers in nonprofits organizations, I had to learn how important the value of every single contribution is. Despite the size of the contribution , praise and recognition has to be shared.
 
If you see that few individuals do the majority of the work, it is great to praise them, but don’t forget the others  that are also putting the time. Without them, the project would never be finished (even if they contribute with just 10% or less, it is still part of the whole)
 
Creating environments where people feel safe and valued is the best way to create inclusive ecosystems. A byproduct of this is that you get to attract other amazing individuals.
 
## Everyone is stardust
 
I tell myself that I’m only a tiny little event that happened in this timeline of the universe. It reminds me how little there is to be afraid of failing. Steve Jobs described this feeling in this famous Stanford commencement speech with “You are already naked”.
 
Most people are so concerned with what they have to lose that they are unable to take risks. If you want something to happen, do whatever is necessary. In the end, you will become stardust anyway, so what stops you from trying while you can?
 
## Do bigger things than you could ‘ever’ handle
 
Contrary to popular wisdom, you should challenge yourself beyond your limits. It is doable and there is a chance of huge returns.
 
The question is: why does popular wisdom suggest that you should only do things up your halley, or a little bit harder?
 
When you commit to something huge, the first challenge is to go through the point of no return. This will transform your thinking, your mind will enter in such a survival mode that you will be the one pushing yourself to the limit.
 
It is like jumping of a plane with no parachute and then having to build the parachute while you are free-falling. The human body was designed to resist situations of great stress. Use that to your advantage.
 
It will be crucial to remind yourself of why you started such an endeavour.

## Persistance, Courage and Confidence trumps everything

## Teach, be a mentor and share your values
 
I’ve had the chance to mentor many young entrepreneurs and engineers. Some of the high school students I worked with had no idea how to plan their future. I had no clue at the time, but each time you teach something, there is a piece of you that stays with the person and, eventually, that piece will come back amplified, people will take that teaching, apply it and create so much value. hen you get to hear that person echoing pieces of the conversation(s) you had years before, sometimes word by word, at that moment, you just think: "Ah! I remember perfectly how I developed that thought and I remember sharing it with you, I remember now how that is important and how it is part of who I am". This has happened to me, countless times, both as the mentor but also as the mentee.
```
 
You can see this as planting seeds and seeing trees grow. You share an idea and years later that person comes back with some extraordinary achievement, quoting that day you talked to and with them. In that precise moment you get an extraordinary validation of your thinking, making that core value so much stronger and significant, it is like someone manages to bend you in shape again.
 
That feeling is extremely powerful; it will make you you. Your mentees are a representation of who you are.
 
Today, I have a very good baseline for what is important to me and how I should operate. Reaching to these and more was a continuous process of retrospective thinking. A good way to get this process started is to look back and to divide your history into logical chunks. For example: high school, college, a job, etc, answering to yourself, what was important back then.
 
I appreciate your time for reading this post. If you have thoughts or questions, you are welcome to email me, I would love to learn what keeps moving **you** forward.
