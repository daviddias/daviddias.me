If you would like to know more in-depth details, make sure to read my [`JavaScript for Higher Education`](http://daviddias.me/blog/javascript-for-higher-education/) post, it contains more of my notes and a talk I delivered at ArticJS.

I want to end with a big thank you to [Lu√≠s Veiga](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~lveiga/) for the invite and trusting me to direct the content of the course.
